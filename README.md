Laserchicken
============

A RSS reader web application built on Rails.

Conceived as a replacement for the late [Google Reader][], and as such it can import your subscriptions from [backups][] (which you can still get until 12PM PST July 15, 2013).

Find Laserchicken on https://github.com/tilboerner/laserchicken .

[Google Reader]: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Reader
[backups]: https://www.google.com/takeout/#custom:reader "Google Reader backups"

### version:

## You need

* Ruby 1.9.3 or above, **Ruby 2.0** preferred  
    * (includes RubyGems in standard library)
* **Bundler** http://bundler.io
* **Rails 4.0** (!) http://rubyonrails.org


## How to...

### Setup

    $ git clone https://github.com/tilboerner/laserchicken.git
    $ cd laserchicken
    $ bundle install
    $ rake db:setup
    $ rails server
    $ firefox http://localhost:3000
    
### Update feeds

Admin users can trigger manual updates from the web interface. The updating is done by a *rake* task, however, so you can get **automatic updates** by scheduling

    $ rake update_active_feeds
    
to run regularly in the application dir.

### Import subscriptions

If you have a subscription list in OPML format, like, say, from your prior [Google Reader][] account, you can import them for your user by running:

    $ rake import_subscriptions_from_opml \
    > OPML_SOURCE=path/to/subscriptions.xml \
    > USER_NAME=your_username

(You can still get Google Reader [backups][] until 12PM PST July 15, 2013.)

### Run in production environment

Rails knows at least three different modes to operate in: *development*, *test*, and *production*. The above instructions should have happened in *development* by default, which is fine while working on the application locally. Running in *production* gives you speed and efficiency (among other things), so if you're done evaluating, you'll want to do that.

To **get production mode**, simply arrange for `$RAILS_ENV` to contain the name of the wanted environment: `RAILS_ENV=production`. You can also start the server with `rails server -e production`.

Since there are different databases for every environment, you need to `rake db:setup` again with the production environment set. If the content of the development DB is dear to you, just copy it to production: 

    $ cp db/development.sqlite3 db/production.sqlite3

(This assumes that you intent to use *SQLite3* for your production database, too.)

If you don't have the `rails server` running behind another web server and want it to serve the static assets for you (like CSS or JavaScript files), you may want to open 

    config/environments/production.rb

and have a look at `config.serve_static_assets` and `config.assets.compile`. Otherwise, relevant files will not get out to the client.

### Learn about Rails

Try out `rails console` and `rails console --sandbox`.
