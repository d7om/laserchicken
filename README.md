Laserchicken
============

RSS reader web application built on Rails.

It was conceived as a replacement for the late [Google Reader][], and as such it can import your subscriptions from a [backup][] (which you can still get until 12PM PST July 15, 2013).

[backups]: https://www.google.com/takeout/#custom:reader "Google Reader backups"

## You need

* Ruby 1.9.3 or above, **Ruby 2.0** preferred  
    * (includes RubyGems in standard library)
* **Bundler** http://bundler.io
* **Rails 4.0** (!) http://rubyonrails.org


## How to...

### setup

    $ git clone https://github.com/tilboerner/laserchicken.git
    $ cd laserchicken
    $ bundle install
    $ rake db:setup
    $ rails server
    $ firefox http://localhost:3000
    
### update feeds

Admin users can trigger manual updates from the web interface. The updating is done by a `rake` task, however, so you can get **automatic updates** by scheduling

    $ rake update_active_feeds
    
to run regularly in the application dir.

### import subscriptions

If you have a subscription list in OPML format, like, say, from your prior [Google Reader][] account, you can import them for your user by running:

    $ rake import_subscriptions_from_opml \
    > OMPL_SOURCE=path/to/subscriptions.xml \
    > USER_NAME=your_username

(You can still get [backups][] until 12PM PST July 15, 2013.)

### run in production environment

Rails knows at least three different modes to operate in: *development*, *test*, and *production*. The above instructions should have happened in *development* by default, which is fine while working on the application locally. 

Running in *production* gives you speed and efficiency (among other things), so if you're done evaluating, you'll want to do that.

To **get production mode**, simply arrange for `$RAILS_ENV` to contain the name of the wanted environment: `RAILS_ENV=production`.

You can also start the server with `rails server -e production`.

Since there are different databases for every environment, you need to 

    $ rake db:setup again
    
,or if the content of the development DB is dear to you, just copy it to production:

    $ cp db/development.sqlite3 db/production.sqlite3
    
This assumes that you intent to use *SQLite3* for your production database, too.

If you want the `rails server` to serve the static assets for you (like CSS or JavaScript files), you may want to open 

    config/environments/production.rb

and have a look at `config.serve_static_assets` and 'config.assets.compile`. Otherwise, relevant files will not go out to the client.

### learn about Rails

Try out `rails console` and `rails console --sandbox`.
