The updating is done by a *rake* task, however, so you can get **automatic updates** by scheduling\r\n\r\n    $ rake update_active_feeds\r\n    \r\nto run regularly in the application dir.\r\n\r\n### Import subscriptions\r\n\r\nIf you have a subscription list in OPML format, like, say, from your prior [Google Reader][] account, you can import them for your user by running:\r\n\r\n    $ rake import_subscriptions_from_opml \\\r\n    > OPML_SOURCE=path/to/subscriptions.xml \\\r\n    > USER_NAME=your_username\r\n\r\n(You can still get Google Reader [backups][] until 12PM PST July 15, 2013.)\r\n\r\n### Run in production environment\r\n\r\nRails knows at least three different modes to operate in: *development*, *test*, and *production*. The above instructions should have happened in *development* by default, which is fine while working on the application locally. Running in *production* gives you speed and efficiency (among other things), so if you're done evaluating, you'll want to do that.\r\n\r\nTo **get production mode**, simply arrange for `$RAILS_ENV` to contain the name of the wanted environment: `RAILS_ENV=production`. You can also start the server with `rails server -e production`.\r\n\r\nSince there are different databases for every environment, you need to `rake db:setup` again with the production environment set. If the content of the development DB is dear to you, just copy it to production: \r\n\r\n    $ cp db/development.sqlite3 db/production.sqlite3\r\n\r\n(This assumes that you intent to use *SQLite3* for your production database, too.)\r\n\r\nIf you don't have the `rails server` running behind another web server and want it to serve the static assets for you (like CSS or JavaScript files), you may want to open \r\n\r\n    config/environments/production.rb\r\n\r\nand have a look at `config.serve_static_assets` and `config.assets.compile`. Otherwise, relevant files will not get out to the client.\r\n\r\n### Learn about Rails\r\n\r\nTry out `rails console` and `rails console --sandbox`. \r\n\r\nReading material, in order of in-depth-ness:\r\n\r\n- [Getting Started](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html)\r\n- [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/)\r\n- [Rails Tutorial](http://ruby.railstutorial.org/ruby-on-rails-tutorial-book?version=4.0) (it's a whole book, also available online)\r\n- [API doc](http://api.rubyonrails.org/).\r\n\r\n## License\r\n\r\n(The MIT License)\r\n \r\nCopyright (c) 2013: Tilman BÃ¶rner (tilman.boerner@gmx.net)\r\n\r\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining\r\na copy of this software and associated documentation files (the\r\n'Software'), to deal in the Software without restriction, including\r\nwithout limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,\r\ndistribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to\r\npermit persons to whom the Software is furnished to do so, subject to\r\nthe following conditions:\r\n \r\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be\r\nincluded in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.\r\n \r\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED 'AS IS', WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND,\r\nEXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF\r\nMERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.\r\nIN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHORS OR COPYRIGHT HOLDERS BE LIABLE FOR ANY\r\nCLAIM, DAMAGES OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT,\r\nTORT OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE\r\nSOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.\r\n\r\nBased on *Ruby on Rails* and *Feedzirra*, also released under the MIT License.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
